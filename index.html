<b>Apples</b>
<p>Apples come in all shades of reds, greens, yellows. 
7500 varieties of apples are grown throughout the world. 
Apples are fat, sodium, and cholesterol free. 
A medium apple is about 80 calories. 
Apples are a great source of the fibre pectin. One apple has five grams of fibre. 
25 percent of an apple's volume is air. That is why they float. 
Apples ripen six to ten times faster at room temperature than if they were refrigerated. 
The old saying, “an apple a day, keeps the doctor away”. This saying comes from am old English adage, “To eat an apple before going to bed, will make the doctor beg his bread.” 
Don't peel your apple. Two-thirds of the fibre and lots of antioxidants are found in the peel Antioxidants help to reduce damage to cells, which can trigger some diseases.

<div id="banana">
<b>Bananas</b>
<p>Bananas are a good source of vitamin C, potassium and dietary fibre.
Bananas have no fat, cholesterol or sodium.
Bananas are great for athletic and fitness activity because they replenish necessary carbohydrates, glycogen and body fluids burned during exercise.
Bananas are available all year-round. They are harvested every day of the year.
The banana industry in Australia is well over 100 years old.
A cluster of bananas is called a hand and consists of 10 to 20 bananas, which are known as fingers.
When you compare it to an apple, it has four times the protein, twice the carbohydrate, three times the phosphorus, </p>

<div id="grape">
<b>Grapes</b>
<p>Grapes were first cultivated over 8000 years ago.
Grapes with black skins are dried to make raisins, whereas sultanas are dried from small seedless green grapes. Americans call all dried grapes ‘raisins’.
There are many hundreds of varieties of grapes but the favourites are:
Green – Thomson seedless, Waltham Cross and Menindee Seedless, 
Purple/Pink – Muscat, Purple Cornichon, Ribiers, Black Muscat, Flame Seedless and Red Globe.
Grapes have a high sugar content with half as glucose and half as fructose.
Grapes also contribute some dietary fibre and vitamin C.
Grapes also contain adequate amounts of potassium and vitamin A and are low in sodium.</p>

<div id="mango">
<b>Mangoes</b>
<p>Mangoes are known as the King of Fruits.
A mango tree doesn’t produce fruit until it’s about four years old.
Mangoes are picked when mature, and more green than yellow.
Mangoes belong to the same family as the cashew and the pistachio nut.
Mangoes are eaten green in parts of Asia, often sprinkled with a mixture of salt and sugar.
Mangoes are now grown in most tropical countries and are abundant in the northern parts of Australia.
In Australia – the most common mango is Kensington Pride or Bowen Special.
Mangoes are an excellent source of vitamin C, beta carotene and other related carotenoids. The deeper the colour of the flesh, the higher the carotenoid level.
Mangoes also supply some dietary fibre.</p>
